# Jenkins
* Jenkins is an open-source automation server widely used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
* It helps automate the building, testing, and deployment of software applications.
* It writtens in java.

# Jenkins Concepts
* --Jobs--Builds--Pipeline-Plugins--Nodes--Triggers--Artifacts--Environment variables--Security--Monitoring--.

* Jobs and Builds:
  * Creating different types of jobs (e.g., Freestyle, Pipeline).
  * Configuring build triggers and parameters.
  * Understanding build steps and post-build actions.

* Pipeline as Code:
  * Learning the concepts of Jenkins Pipeline.
  * Writing and defining pipelines using both Declarative and Scripted syntax.
  * Implementing common pipeline features like stages, steps, and parallel execution.

* Plugins and Integrations:
  * Exploring the Jenkins plugin ecosystem.
  * Installing and managing plugins.
  * Integrating Jenkins with version control systems (e.g., Git, SVN), build tools (e.g., Maven, Gradle), and other external services.

* Security and Authentication:
  * Configuring security settings in Jenkins.
  * Managing users and permissions.
  * Implementing authentication mechanisms like LDAP, Active Directory, or OAuth.

* Monitoring and Reporting:
  * Monitoring build statuses and logs.
  * Generating and interpreting reports (e.g., test reports, code coverage reports).
  * Utilizing monitoring and metrics plugins

# Continuous Integration (CI):
 * In CI, developers frequently integrate their code changes into a shared repository, typically multiple times a day.
 * Jenkins automatically triggers builds whenever new code is pushed to the repository.
 * During the build process, Jenkins compiles the code, runs automated tests, and generates build artifacts.
 * If the build is successful, developers receive immediate feedback. If not, Jenkins alerts developers to the issues, allowing them to fix problems early in the development cycle.

# Continuous Delivery (CD):
 * Continuous Delivery extends CI by automating the deployment process up to the staging or pre-production environment.
 * After a successful build, Jenkins deploys the application to a staging environment for further testing and validation.
 * Automated tests, including integration tests and user acceptance tests, are run against the deployed application to ensure its quality.
 * If the application passes all tests in the staging environment, it's considered ready for release.

# Continuous Deployment (CD):
 * Continuous Deployment takes automation a step further by deploying the application automatically to production environments after passing through the CI/CD pipeline.
 * Once the application passes all tests in the staging environment, Jenkins automatically promotes it to production, eliminating manual intervention.
 * Automated deployment scripts and configuration management tools ensure consistency and reliability in the production deployment process.
 * Continuous monitoring and feedback loops help identify and resolve issues in production quickly.

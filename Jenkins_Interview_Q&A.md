# What is Jenkins?
* Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) of software projects. It automates the process of building, testing, and deploying applications.

# How do you install Jenkins?
* Jenkins can be installed on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. It can be installed through native package managers, Docker, or by downloading and running the Jenkins WAR file.

# What is a Jenkins Pipeline?
* Jenkins Pipeline is a suite of plugins that supports the creation and automation of pipelines as code. It allows you to define your entire build process in a Jenkinsfile, which can be version-controlled along with your application code.

# What is a Jenkinsfile?
* A Jenkinsfile is a text file that contains the definition of a Jenkins Pipeline. It describes the steps of the build process, including stages, steps, and post-actions, using a Groovy-based DSL (Domain-Specific Language).

# How do you trigger a Jenkins build?
* Jenkins builds can be triggered manually by users or automatically based on predefined triggers such as code commits, scheduled builds, or external events using webhooks.

# Explain the concept of Jenkins Agents/Nodes.
* Jenkins Agents (formerly known as slaves) are machines that execute Jenkins build jobs. They are used to distribute workload and run builds on different environments. Nodes are instances of Jenkins Agents.

# What are Jenkins Plugins?
* Jenkins Plugins are extensions that add functionality to Jenkins. They can integrate Jenkins with version control systems, build tools, cloud services, and more.

# How do you secure Jenkins?
* Jenkins can be secured using various methods, including enabling authentication, configuring authorization strategies, securing the Jenkins URL with HTTPS, and using plugins like Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

# Explain Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).
* Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository, where each integration triggers automated builds and tests.
* Continuous Deployment (CD) is the automated process of deploying code changes to production environments after passing through the CI pipeline.

# How do you archive artifacts in Jenkins?
* Jenkins allows you to archive build artifacts such as compiled binaries, test results, and documentation. This can be configured in the post-build actions of a Jenkins job.

# What are the different types of Jenkins jobs?
* Jenkins supports various job types, including Freestyle projects, Pipeline projects, Maven projects, and Multibranch Pipeline projects.

# How do you debug failed Jenkins builds?
* Failed builds can be debugged by analyzing build logs, examining error messages, checking configuration settings, and running builds in debug mode.

# Explain Blue Ocean in Jenkins.
* Blue Ocean is a user interface plugin for Jenkins that provides a modern, visual way to create, visualize, and manage Jenkins Pipeline projects. It offers a more intuitive and user-friendly experience compared to the classic Jenkins UI.

# How do you scale Jenkins for large projects?
* Jenkins can be scaled for large projects by setting up multiple Jenkins Agents on different machines, using distributed builds, optimizing resource usage, and configuring master-slave architectures.
